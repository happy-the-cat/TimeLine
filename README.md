A companion program created utilizing Java and JavaFX with the goal of helping its users efficiently use their time. 
Through functions such as: keeping track of their productivity; setting up their personal schedule, and even giving randomly generated tips in 
helping manage their time efficiently. The designs aim to allow the user to create a 7-day schedule with all the chosen tasks to their liking,
